## 🔬 Technical Analysis

### Architecture Health
The extension maintains a clean, modular architecture:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has distinct responsibilities
- **Dependency Injection**: Services properly decoupled
- **Interface Contracts**: Type-safe interactions between modules
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management throughout

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Module Cohesion**: High cohesion within modules
- **Coupling**: Low coupling between modules
- **Documentation**: Well-documented with JSDoc comments

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **ESLint Configuration**: Needs updating for new config format (cosmetic only)
   - Impact: None on functionality
   - Solution: Update eslint.config.js format

2. **Unit Tests**: Require VS Code test runner environment
   - Impact: Cannot run tests via npm directly
   - Solution: Use VS Code Extension Test Runner

### Performance Optimizations Opportunities
- Bundle size could be further optimized
- Lazy loading for rarely used features
